### 2. 🐍 Python – API Testing: Identifying Defects in Product Data

This script performs **automated validation of product data** returned by a public API.

🔗 **API Endpoint:** [https://fakestoreapi.com/products](https://fakestoreapi.com/products)

The script sends a GET request to the API and verifies that each product object in the response meets the following
conditions:

**Steps to run:**

1. Make sure **Python 3** is installed
2. Run the script from the terminal:

   ```bash
   python python/identifying_defects_in_product_data.py
